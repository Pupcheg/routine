# Routine Core Types

Small set of core generic types intended for everyday use in Java code. The implementations are
minimalistic, immutable, and designed to integrate naturally with the Java standard library.

The primary focus is on clear type semantics, the absence of implicit conventions, and seamless integration with the
Java Stream API.
